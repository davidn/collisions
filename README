Collisions - A 1D particle collision suite
Copyright (c) 2009, David Newgas <dn271@cam.ac.uk>

Collisions consists of several programs for simulating 1D elastic particle
collisions.

The programs must be compiled, to do this run
./configure && make

the main program is `collisions` it takes as input a set of bodies and outputs
the state of every particle at every collision.
It expects input in the format:
inverse-mass radius position velocity
and outputs in the format:
time particle-1-x particle-1-y ...

the program `interpolate` is not very useful, but will take the output of
collisions are recast it in the same format, but at regular intervals.

the program `gas` generates a group of particles.  It currently gives them all
the same speed, in random directions.  It expects on the command line, first the
number of particles, then their mass and radius, then the start and end range of
positions they can be in, and then their speed.

the program `plot` is an example gnuplot script.  It will plot 12 particles in
the file /tmp/bar.

the program `RUNME` is an overall example session.  It creates a random 10
particle gas between two walls, and simulates them and plots them over 10
seconds.
